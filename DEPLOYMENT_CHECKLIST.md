## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Environment Variables

**Backend (Render)**
```env
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_key_production_2024
PORT=10000
```

**Frontend (Vercel)**
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-render-backend-url.onrender.com/api
```

### Step 2: Deploy Backend to Render

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Create new Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure:
   - **Name**: `convergence-backend`
   - **Environment**: `Node`
   - **Build Command**: `cd backend && npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `cd backend && npm start`
   - **Plan**: Free
5. Add environment variables
6. Deploy

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Create new project
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Configure:
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite
   - **Root Directory**: `frontend`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`
5. Add environment variables
6. Deploy

## ðŸ§ª Post-Deployment Testing

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds: `GET /`
- [ ] API endpoints are accessible
- [ ] CORS is working
- [ ] Database operations work

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Can connect to backend API
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] User login works
- [ ] Product management works
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Full user flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Authentication persists across page reloads
- [ ] Error handling works properly
- [ ] Loading states display correctly

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues to Watch For

### Backend Issues
- **Port conflicts**: Ensure PORT is set to 10000 in Render
- **Database permissions**: LowDB should create files automatically
- **Environment variables**: Check all are set correctly
- **Dependencies**: Ensure all are in package.json

### Frontend Issues
- **API URL**: Verify VITE_API_URL points to correct backend
- **Build errors**: Check for missing dependencies
- **CORS errors**: Backend should allow all origins
- **Environment variables**: Must be prefixed with VITE_

### General Issues
- **Git repository**: Ensure all changes are committed and pushed
- **Branch**: Deployments use main/master branch
- **File permissions**: Should be handled by platforms
- **SSL/HTTPS**: Both platforms provide this automatically

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Setup

### Render Monitoring
- [ ] Set up log monitoring
- [ ] Configure resource usage alerts
- [ ] Set up downtime notifications

### Vercel Monitoring
- [ ] Enable analytics
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Configure error tracking

## ðŸ”’ Security Review

- [ ] JWT secret is strong and unique
- [ ] No secrets committed to Git
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting is active
- [ ] Input validation is working

## ðŸ“ž Support Resources

- **Render Docs**: [docs.render.com](https://docs.render.com)
- **Vercel Docs**: [vercel.com/docs](https://vercel.com/docs)
- **Project Issues**: GitHub repository issues
- **Community**: Stack Overflow, Discord, etc.
